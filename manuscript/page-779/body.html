Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city. Ha'n't you no such relations, Mr. George?"</p><p>Mr. George, still composedly smoking, replies, "If I had, I shouldn't trouble them. I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day. It MAY be a very good sort of penitence in a vagabond, who has wasted the best time of his life, to go back then to decent people that he never was a credit to and live upon them, but it's not my sort. The best kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away, in my opinion."</p><p>"But natural affection, Mr. George," hints Grandfather Smallweed.</p></div> </div>
