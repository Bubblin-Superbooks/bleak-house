Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea.</p><p>But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes a short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and enters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so in the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed candle in his hand.</p><p>"Pray is your lodger within?"</p><p>"Male or female, sir?" says Mr. Krook.</p><p>"Male.
