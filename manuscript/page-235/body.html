<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">A dark-eyed, dark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in—so fresh in her rosy and yet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her hair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.</p><p>"What company is this, Rosa?" says Mrs. Rouncewell.</p><p>"It's two young men in a gig, ma'am, who want to see the house—yes, and if you please, I told them so!" in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper. "I went to the hall-door and told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you."</p><p>"Read it, my dear Watt," says the housekeeper.</p><p>Rosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is shyer than before.</p><p>"Mr. Guppy" is all the information the card yields.</p></div> </div>
