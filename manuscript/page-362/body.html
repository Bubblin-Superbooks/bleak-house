Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.</p><p>"Did you wish to see him, sir?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"It's what I seldom do myself," says Mr. Krook with a grin. "Shall I call him down? But it's a weak chance if he'd come, sir!"</p><p>"I'll go up to him, then," says Mr. Tulkinghorn.</p><p>"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!" Mr. Krook, with his cat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Hi-hi!" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.</p><p>"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know what they say of my lodger?" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.</p></div> </div>
