When I went in, his face cleared and he came to his seat, but he caught the light upon my face as I took mine.</p><p>"Little woman," said he, "You have been crying."</p><p>"Why, yes, guardian," said I, "I am afraid I have been, a little. Ada has been in such distress, and is so very sorry, guardian."</p><p>I put my arm on the back of his chair, and I saw in his glance that my words and my look at her empty place had prepared him.</p><p>"Is she married, my dear?"</p><p>I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness.</p><p>"She has no need of it," said he. "Heaven bless her and her husband!" But just as my first impulse had been to pity her, so was his. "Poor girl, poor girl! Poor Rick! Poor Ada!"</p></div> </div>
