You will not be discomposed by the Lord Chancellor, I dare say?"</p><p>"No, sir," I said, "I don't think I shall," really not seeing on consideration why I should be.</p><p>So Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a colonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage, into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young gentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was interposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen, talking.</p><p>They both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with the fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich golden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent, trusting face!</p><p>"Miss Ada," said Mr. Kenge, "this is Miss Summerson."</p></div> </div>
