"Is that tantamount, sir, to acceptance, or rejection, or consideration?"</p><p>"To decided rejection, if you please," returned my guardian.</p><p>Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend, and at his mother, who suddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling.</p><p>"Indeed?" said he.

Get out with you!"</p></div> </div>
