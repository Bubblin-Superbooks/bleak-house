There are reasons now known to me, reasons in which you have no part, rendering it far better for you that you should not remain here. You must not remain here. I have determined that you shall not. I have written to the father of your lover, and he will be here to-day. All this I have done for your sake."</p><p>The weeping girl covers her hand with kisses and says what shall she do, what shall she do, when they are separated! Her mistress kisses her on the cheek and makes no other answer.</p><p>"Now, be happy, child, under better circumstances. Be beloved and happy!"</p><p>"Ah, my Lady, I have sometimes thought—forgive my being so free—that YOU are not happy."</p><p>"I!"</p><p>"Will you be more so when you have sent me away? Pray, pray, think again. Let me stay a little while!"</p></div> </div>
