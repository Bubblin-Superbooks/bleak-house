I only wish I had been better brought up and was likely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him."</p><p>"I am sorry to hear this," said I, "I must confess."</p><p>"I don't know why you should be sorry," she retorted a little anxiously, "but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he is very fond of me.

Old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed—very gentlemanly."</p><p>"Does his wife know of it?" asked Ada.</p></div> </div>
