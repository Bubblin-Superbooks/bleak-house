I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day, and of day melting into night again; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling.</p><p>On the second morning I heard her dear voice—Oh, how dear now!—outside; and I asked Charley, with some difficulty (speech being painful to me), to go and say I was asleep. I heard her answer softly, "Don't disturb her, Charley, for the world!"</p><p>"How does my own Pride look, Charley?" I inquired.</p><p>"Disappointed, miss," said Charley, peeping through the curtain.</p><p>"But I know she is very beautiful this morning."</p><p>"She is indeed, miss," answered Charley, peeping.
