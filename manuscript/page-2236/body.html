The door was behind him, but he had observed in my face that some one was there.</p><p>I looked to Allan for advice, and as he nodded "Yes," bent over Richard and told him. My guardian saw what passed, came softly by me in a moment, and laid his hand on Richard's. "Oh, sir," said Richard, "you are a good man, you are a good man!" and burst into tears for the first time.</p><p>My guardian, the picture of a good man, sat down in my place, keeping his hand on Richard's.</p><p>"My dear Rick," said he, "the clouds have cleared away, and it is bright now. We can see now. We were all bewildered, Rick, more or less. What matters! And how are you, my dear boy?"</p><p>"I am very weak, sir, but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to begin the world."</p><p>"Aye, truly; well said!" cried my guardian.</p></div> </div>
