Lady Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I had known her.</p><p>"Miss Summerson, I am afraid I have startled you," she said, now advancing slowly. "You can scarcely be strong yet. You have been very ill, I know. I have been much concerned to hear it."</p><p>I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat. She gave me her hand, and its deadly coldness, so at variance with the enforced composure of her features, deepened the fascination that overpowered me. I cannot say what was in my whirling thoughts.</p><p>"You are recovering again?" she asked kindly.</p><p>"I was quite well but a moment ago, Lady Dedlock."</p><p>"Is this your young attendant?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me?"</p></div> </div>
