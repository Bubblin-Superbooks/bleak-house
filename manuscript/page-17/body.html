Most of the shops lighted two hours before their timeâ€”as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling look.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament</p></div> </div>
