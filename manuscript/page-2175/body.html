Among such objects rides the trooper, looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find.</p><p>At last, on the black canal bridge of a busy town, with a clang of iron in it, and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet, the trooper, swart with the dust of the coal roads, checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts.</p><p>"Why, master," quoth the workman, "do I know my own name?"</p><p>"'Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?" asks the trooper.</p><p>"Rouncewell's?
