<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Arrived in Lincoln's Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn's stair, he finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut, but the trooper not knowing much about outer doors, and the staircase being dark besides, he is yet fumbling and groping about, hoping to discover a bell-handle or to open the door for himself, when Mr. Tulkinghorn comes up the stairs (quietly, of course) and angrily asks, "Who is that? What are you doing there?"</p><p>"I ask your pardon, sir. It's George. The sergeant."</p><p>"And couldn't George, the sergeant, see that my door was locked?"</p><p>"Why, no, sir, I couldn't. At any rate, I didn't," says the trooper, rather nettled.</p><p>"Have you changed your mind? Or are you in the same mind?" Mr. Tulkinghorn demands. But he knows well enough at a glance.</p><p>"In the same mind, sir."</p></div> </div>
