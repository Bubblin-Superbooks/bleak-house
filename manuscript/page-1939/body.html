Oh, my Lady, may I beg a word with you?"</p><p>What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so? Far happier than her Lady, as her Lady has often thought, why does she falter in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust?</p><p>"What is the matter? Sit down and take your breath."</p><p>"Oh, my Lady, my Lady. I have found my sonâ€”my youngest, who went away for a soldier so long ago. And he is in prison."</p></div> </div>
