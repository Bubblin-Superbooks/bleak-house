"Caddy, my love," I replied, "I begin to have a great affection for you, and I hope we shall become friends."</p><p>"Oh, do you?" cried Caddy. "How happy that would make me!"</p><p>"My dear Caddy," said I, "let us be friends from this time, and let us often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right way through them." Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller consideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.</p></div> </div>
